***ATENTION*: I only have access to Windows and therefore am unable to confirm if my Makefile works on linux/mac. Feedback and fixes/tips from linux/mac users would be very much apreciated**
# 🎮 FlappyBirbCpp

A small flappy bird clone written in C++ using [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) and [Lua](https://www.lua.org/download.html).  

> Purpose: practicing C++, game architecture, cross-platform builds but mainly, game optimization.  

in my python flappy bird clone, i have multiple inoptimal operations like reloading textures every frame and recreating my text font every frame. Here, i'll apply concepts of optimization such as pre-loadig textures and applying scale before entering the loop

## 📦 Dependencies

Required tools:

- **C++11** or newer
- **GNU make**
- **Lua libs** (included with the project)
- **raylib** (included with the project)
- **gcc / clang / mingw-w64**

You **do NOT** need to install raylib manually.  
It is built from the repository source.

## 🛠️ Installing Build Tools

### 🐧 Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)

```bash
sudo apt update
```

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential git libx11-dev libxrandr-dev libxi-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libxcursor-dev mesa-utils
```

### 🐧 Arch Linux
```bash
sudo pacman -S base-devel libx11 libxrandr libxi libxcursor mesa
```

### 🍎 MacOS (homebrew)
You're a mac user? u already have make bro

### 🪟 Windows (MSYS2 + MinGW)
1 - Install MSYS2 → https://www.msys2.org/

2 - Open MSYS2 UCRT64 or MSYS2 MINGW64 and run:
```bash
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc mingw-w64-x86_64-make git
```

## 🚀 Building and Running

### In the terminal

▶️ Linux / macOS:  
To build:
```bash
make
```

To run:
```bash
make run
```

to clean:
```bash
make clean
```


🪟 Windows (MinGW):

To build:
```bash
mingw32-make
```

To run:
```bash
mingw32-make run
```

to clean:
```bash
mingw32-make clean
```

### Through tasks

alternatively you can run the repective tasks in tasks.json, if in vs code

▶️ Linux / macOS:

build (make);  
run (make);  
clean (make)

🪟 Windows (MinGW):

windows build (make);  
windows run (make);  
windows clean (make)

#### No make
My college computers have no make nor can i install stuff in them. for that, and for those who are in a similar situation, i made tasks to compile without using make, just the terminal
**This removes the need for make but other requirements still stand**

🪟 windows compile (no-make);  
🐧 linux compile (no-make);  
🍎 osx compile (no-make)
